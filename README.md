Generate Shadowsocks URLs
-------------------------

Given a Shadowsocks configuration file, this will generate the URL needed to connect to that server.

It can also produce QR codes, either printed directly to the terminal or saved as PNG or SVG files.

Run with `--help` for basic usage information.
